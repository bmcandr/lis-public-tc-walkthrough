== Overview

The {url-lis-website}[Land Information System framework (LISF)] public testcases described in this document are provided for users to learn how to run and test the LISF code. The testcases include a full end-to-end suite of Land Data Toolkit (LDT), Land Information System (LIS), and Land Verification Toolkit (LVT) cases that build off each other and demonstrate how to generate model parameter and assimilation-based input files using LDT, run the Noah land surface model (LSM) for a sample "open-loop" (or baseline) experiment and a data assimilation (DA) experiment using LIS, and compare output from the sample experiments using LVT. While these testcases were created to demonstrate the use of LISF, the files provided _could_ be expanded to support research-related model runs.
